Data Cleaning Process (Python) 🧼🐍

Before importing into Power BI, the raw data was cleaned using pandas:

import pandas as pd

#load the dataset
df=pd.read_csv("WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition (1).csv")
print(df)

#drop irrevelant column
df.drop(columns=['EmployeeCount','Over18','StandardHours','EmployeeNumber'],inplace=True)

#Create some features
df['IsOverTime']=df['OverTime'].map({'Yes':1,'No':0})
df['AttritionFlag']=df['Attrition'].map({'Yes':1,'No':0})
df['YearsWithCompanyRatio']=df['YearsWithCurrManager']/df['TotalWorkingYears']

#fill any missing values
df.fillna(0,inplace=True)

#check missing values
df.isnull().sum()
df.to_csv("HR_Anlaytics.csv",index=False)
